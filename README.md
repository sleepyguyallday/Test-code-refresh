testing if i can translate what I learned from C into Python and getting better

Hello there!

I am Enrico Jesus Palma, a chemist and material scientist by profession. 
I decided to get a GitHub account thinking that it will serve a big purpose in my further studies and will help in visualization of complex solutions as I plan to proceed with further studies soon. 
Also, I am jealous of my friends who have their work published citing that GitHub helped them.
